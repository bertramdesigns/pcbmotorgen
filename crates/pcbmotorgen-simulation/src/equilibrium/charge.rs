//! Charge-based travel endpoints (kata k5r5): the first/last magnet
//! equilibrium under the phase-band charge state.
//!
//! The geometric flush clamp ([`super::travel_envelope_over_slots`], kata
//! 5c7r) gives the MECHANICAL travel limits. The true min/max mover position
//! is ELECTROMAGNETIC: it derives from the charge within the first and last
//! phase bands of each phase. With the first phase band of the reference
//! phase fully charged and the remaining phases at their commutation-model
//! offsets, that three-phase charge state fixes where the FIRST magnet
//! settles (its resting position); the last phase bands fix the LAST magnet
//! the same way. With 1:1 spacing (magnet pitch = coil pitch) only the two
//! end magnets need solving — the rigid mover at fixed pitch puts every
//! interior magnet on the same equilibrium lattice.
//!
//! ## The solve
//!
//! **Numerical authority** — [`solve_end_magnet_rest_m`]: the net axial
//! Lorentz force on the END magnet alone (single-magnet assembly, fixed
//! charge excitation on the coils, reusing the existing
//! `magnetic::coil_model` + `physics` force model — no new field solver),
//! bracketed over the settle window at the relevant copper end and bisected
//! ([`REST_TOLERANCE_M`], deterministic grid + bisection). Zeros are
//! classified stable/unstable by the full-array (rigid mover) force slope;
//! the outermost stable zero is the end magnet's rest.
//!
//! **Analytic reference** — [`charge_state_electrical_angle`]: the crate's
//! pinned equilibrium convention ([`super::rest_phase_m`], the skill
//! reference's worked example) maps a charge state to its Clarke angle and
//! hence to the ideal continuous-winding lattice
//! `x ≡ θe·P_e/(2π) (mod P_e)` (baseline `(1, 0, −1)` → θe = π/6 →
//! `P_e/12`). The DISCRETE leg model's zero positions carry a documented
//! layout phase and edge distortion the pure lattice cannot express (the
//! tests characterise both), so the solved rests — not the lattice — are the
//! endpoint authority. The lattice INVARIANTS the tests pin instead: the
//! interior zero recurrence at exactly `P_e`, the reversed-charge half-period
//! symmetry, and the interior rigid pitch `τ_p`.
//!
//! With 1:1 spacing (magnet pitch = coil pitch) only the two END magnets
//! need solving — the rigid mover at fixed pitch puts every interior magnet
//! on the same equilibrium lattice (pinned by the interior-pitch test).
//!
//! ## Integration shape (kata k5r5 option b)
//!
//! [`travel_envelope_charge_based`] derives the envelope endpoints from the
//! solved charge equilibria and clamps them INTO the span-aware flush
//! limits — the geometric clamp remains the documented mechanical LIMIT (the
//! charge refinement can only pull endpoints inward, never past the
//! copper-bounded design range) and the FALLBACK whenever the charge solve
//! is unavailable (no coils, non-3-phase layouts, degenerate copper). The
//! existing [`super::travel_envelope_over_slots`] /
//! [`super::travel_envelope_from_phase_bands`] outputs are unchanged: the
//! authority's reference output for the desktop pins (36 → 111 mm) is
//! untouched by this module — on the reference fixture BOTH raw charge rests
//! overhang the design limits, so the refined envelope equals the flush
//! clamp exactly (measured and pinned).
//!
//! ## Declared phase bands (kata hzs2 discipline)
//!
//! [`band_charge_state`] consumes the declared band centerlines when
//! `SimulationInput.phase_bands` carries them (matched per distinct phase
//! label, ordered spatially) and falls back to the analytic slot model
//! (`slot s ∈ [s·τ_band, (s+1)·τ_band]` anchored at the copper start,
//! `phase(s) = s mod phases`) otherwise. The requester's "120° offset"
//! phrasing is the classic balanced-law convention (glossary "Commutation"):
//! the crate's per-coil offset law `π·τ_band/τ_p` gives 60° for the default
//! 3-phase 1:1 layout — the solver consumes whatever offsets the
//! commutation model declares, which is the general case.
