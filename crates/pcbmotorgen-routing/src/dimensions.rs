//! Board-to-magnet dimensions reported alongside generated routing geometry.
//!
//! A [`RoutingResult`] deliberately contains only raw
//! geometry.  Consumers that need to place or evaluate the mover also need the
//! dimensions that gave that geometry meaning: the centre-to-centre pole pitch
//! and the width of each active conductor band (phase band).  This module owns those
//! calculations so the application, Python runners, and native plugins all use
//! the same equations.
//!
//! Alongside the phase-band quantities, patterns that declare a
//! [`LegGrid`](crate::model::LegGrid) on their result get true per-slot
//! metrics: the single-leg slot width, the slot pitch
//! `tau_s = L_stator / N_slots`, and the braided-pattern interleave step
//! `tau_p / (phases × strands)`. A slot houses ONE active leg — never a whole
//! coil bundle (glossary "Slot").
//!
//! All lengths are millimetres.  `angle_rad` is measured from the direction of
//! motion (the x axis).
