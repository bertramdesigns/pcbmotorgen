/**
 * coilPreviewViewState.svelte.ts
 * ============================================================================
 * Shared presentation state for the coil preview's two views (the inline
 * card and the expanded lightbox).
 *
 * CoilPreview instantiates this class ONCE and passes it down, so the
 * renderer's draw effect and the CoilPreviewLightbox toggle row read and
 * write ONE source of truth: a toggle flipped in the lightbox immediately
 * repaints the shared schematic, and the state survives open/close cycles.
 *
 * The class carries NO geometry: what the toggles DO (camera-fit unions,
 * segment filters, zone filtering) is derived in lib/previewGeometry
 * consumers (CoilPreview.svelte) — this is the plain presentation state.
