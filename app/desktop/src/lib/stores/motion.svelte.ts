/**
 * Shared mover-position state for the design reflection.
 *
 * Owned by App.svelte and passed to both the TravelDiagram (position slider /
 * iso view) and the CoilPreview (magnet strip shading), so dragging the
 * position in one place moves the magnet overlay in the other.
 *
 * The value is the CENTER of the magnet array in ABSOLUTE TRACK coordinates
 * (the routing/domain frame: the copper active area is
 * [0, active_area_length_m], no padding offset) — the same frame every
 * preview draws in. Motion input is continuous: a coreless motor has no
 * detent/cogging force.
 *
 * Travel envelope (kata ab30): the RANGE endpoints and the rest phase come
 * EXCLUSIVELY from the backend — the `travel_envelope` Tauri command backed
 * by `pcbmotorgen_simulation::equilibrium::charge::travel_envelope_charge_based`
 * (charge-based endpoints clamped into the span-aware flush limits, kata
 * k5r5 + 5c7r). This store does NOT re-derive that
 * math. Until a plausible envelope is installed — and whenever the
 * browser-dev placeholder mock is active — the bounds come from the shared
 * fixed PLACEHOLDER_TRAVEL_ENVELOPE (lib/ipc/mocks.ts) and the
 * "travel envelope unavailable — backend required" warning is raised via
 * `envelopeWarning`, so placeholder numbers are never mistaken for real
 * physics.
